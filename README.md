Question 1: Website Creation
Website Concept: I created a Personal Forex Trading Journey website.
Content: The site serves as a portfolio to document my progress in the financial markets. It includes:
•	A welcoming introduction about my mission to help others. 
•	A structured table displaying free daily trading signals. 
•	A functional contact form and a direct link to my Facebook community page. 
Question 2: HTML Elements
1.	5 Challenging Elements: 
•	<table>: Aligning the rows (<tr>) and data cells (<td>) for signals required high attention to detail. 
•	<form>: Linking labels to inputs using id and for was a multi-step process. 
•	<figure>: Nesting the chart image and its caption correctly for semantic accuracy. 
•	<nav>: Organizing list items (<li>) into a functional menu. 
•	<a>: Setting up "anchor links" to jump to different sections of the same page. 
2.	Semantic Structure: I used <header> for branding, <nav> for the menu, <main> for the core content, and <footer> for risk disclaimers. This tells the browser exactly what each section represents rather than just using generic boxes. 
3.	Most Useful Element: The <section> tag. It allowed me to break the "Journey," "Signals," and "Contact" areas into logical, independent chunks, making the code much easier to read and manage. 
Question 3: HTML Attributes
1.	3 Essential Attributes: * href: To connect users to my Facebook page. 
•	src: To display my technical analysis charts. 
•	alt: To ensure visually impaired users understand what the chart represents. 
2.	Class vs. ID: I used id as a unique "name" for specific sections (like signals) so I could link to them. I used class (if applicable) to group similar items that might need the same styling later. 
3.	User Experience: The placeholder attribute. It gives the user a helpful hint inside the form box (like "Enter your email"), making the site feel much more professional and intuitive. 
Question 4: Development Process
1.	Planning: I started by sketching a simple "Wireframe" on paper to decide where the chart, the signals table, and the contact info would go before I wrote a single line of code. 
2.	Testing/Debugging: I opened my index.html in different browsers (Chrome and microsoft edge) to make sure everything looked the same. 
3.	Challenges: My biggest challenge was getting the image size right without using CSS. I overcame this by using the HTML width and height attributes directly on the <img> tag. 
Question 5: Git & GitHub Implementation
1.	Commands Used: git init (to start), git add . (to stage), git commit -m (to save), and git push (to upload). 
2.	Strategy: I made roughly 5-8 commits. My strategy was to commit after finishing each major section (e.g., "Add signals table" or "Add contact form") so I could easily go back if I made a mistake. 
3.	Importance: Version control is like a "Time Machine." If I break my code while trying something new, I can instantly restore the previous working version without losing progress. 
Question 6: Code Quality & Best Practices
1.	Ensuring Validity: I followed a "clean nesting" rule—always closing tags in the reverse order they were opened—and used a validator to confirm the code was error-free. 
2.	Best Practices: I used consistent indentation (2 spaces) and kept all my tags and attributes in lowercase to follow industry standards. 
3.	Future Improvements: If I had more time, I would add CSS to make the signals table look more modern and JavaScript to make the "Free Signals" update automatically with live market prices.
